| Option   |  Description |
|---|---|
|  ProxyType | Type of proxy used to connect to BigQuery through ODBC and SDK connectors. </br>HTTP (default), http_no_tunnel, socks4 and socks5 are currently supported. |
|  ProxyHost | Hostname or IP address where the proxy can be reached. |
| ProxyPort | Port number the proxy is running on, e.g. 8080 |
| ProxyUid | Username used for the authenticated proxy |
| ProxyPwd | ProxyUid password |
| bqpath | Note that this is applicable for bulk-load tool only (Cloud SDK). </br> To avoid using PATH variable or if the google-cloud-sdk directory has to be moved to another location, you can specify with this option the exact path to the cloud sdk bin directory on the server. |
| GCloudConfigName | Note that this is applicable starting release 7.3.4 release and  for bulk-load tool only (Cloud SDK).</br> The Google Cloud SDK uses configurations to load data into BigQuery tables. The configuration named `accfda` stores the parameters for loading the data. However, this option allows users to specify a different name for the configuration. |
| GCloudDefaultConfigName | Note that this is applicable starting release 7.3.4 release and for bulk-load tool only (Cloud SDK).</br> The active Google Cloud SDK configuration cannot be deleted without first transferring the active tag to a new configuration. This temporary configuration is necessary to recreate the main configuration for loading data. The default name for the temporary configuration is `default`, this can be changed if needed.|
| GCloudRecreateConfig | Note that this is applicable starting release 7.3.4 release and for bulk-load tool only (Cloud SDK).</br> When set to `false`, the bulk loading mechanism refrains from attempting to recreate, delete, or modify the Google Cloud SDK configurations. Instead, it proceeds with data loading using the existing configuration on the machine. This feature is valuable when other operations depend on Google Cloud SDK configurations. </br> If the user enables this engine option without a proper configuration, the bulk loading mechanism will issue a warning message: `No active configuration found. Please either create it manually or remove the GCloudRecreateConfig option`. To prevent further errors, it will then revert to using the default ODBC Array Insert bulk loading mechanism. |

|  chunkSize | Determines the file size of the bulk-loader chunk. By default set to 128MB. Can be modified for a more optimal performance, when used with bulkThreads. More concurrently active threads mean better performance. <br>For more on this, refer to [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/sql-reference/sql/put.html).|
