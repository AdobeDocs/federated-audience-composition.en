>abstract="In this screen, you can access the full list of compositions, check their current status, last/next execution dates, and create a new composition."

Compositions are accessible from the Adobe Experience Platform **[!UICONTROL Audiences]** menu, in the **[!UICONTROL Federated compositions]** tab within the **[!UICONTROL Customers]** section.

From this screen, you can create new compositions and access existing ones. You can also duplicate or delete an existing composition by selecting the ellipsis button next to its name.

You can also view information about the compositions, including the name, status, creator, and last modified date.

| Status | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **[!UICONTROL Draft]** | The composition has been created and saved. |
| **[!UICONTROL In progress]** | The composition has been executed and is currently running. |
| **[!UICONTROL Stopped]** | The composition execution is complete and has stopped. |
| **[!UICONTROL Paused]** | The composition execution has been paused. |
| **[!UICONTROL Erroneous]** | The composition execution has encountered an error. To view more information about the error, open the composition and access the logs. |

You can learn how to start or stop a composition in the [start and monitor composition guide](./start-monitor-composition.md).

To refine the list and find the composition you are looking for, you can search the list, and filter compositions by their statuses or last processing dates.

You can also customize the list by adding or removing columns. To do this, select the **[!UICONTROL Configure columns]** button and add or remove the desired output columns.
