The **Change dimension** activity allows you to change the schema, also known as targeting dimension, as you are building your audience. It shifts the axis depending on the data template and the input schema.

## Configure the Change dimension activity {#configure}

Follow these steps to configure the **Change dimension** activity:

## Example {#example}

In this example, we want to send an SMS delivery to all the profiles who have made a purchase. To do this, we first use a **[!UICONTROL Build audience]** activity linked to a custom "Purchase" targeting dimension to target all purchases that occurred.

We then use a **[!UICONTROL Change dimension]** activity to switch the workflow targeting dimension to "Recipients". This allows us to be able to target the recipients who match the query.
