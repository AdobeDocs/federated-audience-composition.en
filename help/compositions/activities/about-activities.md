# Work with activities {#activities}

## List of activities {#activity-list}

In Federated Audience Composition, activities are specific to targeting. They let you build one or more targets by defining an audience and splitting or combining these audiences using intersection, union or exclusion operations.

<!--to update -->

* [Change dimension](change-dimension.md): Change the targeting dimension as you are building your composition.
* [Combine](combine.md): Perform segmentation on your inbound population. You can use a union, an intersection or an exclusion.
* [Deduplication](deduplication.md): Delete duplicates in the result(s) of the inbound activities.
* [Enrichment](enrichment.md): Define additional data to process in your composition. With this activity, you can leverage the inbound transition and configure the activity to complete the output transition with additional data.
* [Reconciliation](reconciliation.md): Define the link between the data in the database and the data in a work table, for example data loaded from an external file.
* [Save audience](save-audience.md): Update an existing audience or create a new audience from the population computed upstream in a composition.
* [Split](split.md): Segment incoming population into several subsets.
