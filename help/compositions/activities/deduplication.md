The **Deduplication** activity allows you to delete duplicates in the result(s) of the inbound activities, for example duplicated profiles in the recipient list. The **Deduplication** activity is generally used following targeting activities, and before activities that allow the use of targeted data.

## Configure the Deduplication activity{#deduplication-configuration}

Follow these steps to configure the **Deduplication** activity:

1. Add a **Deduplication** activity to your composition.

1. If the activity has several inbound transitions, select the transition to use to perform deduplication from the **[!UICONTROL Primary set]** drop-down list

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Fields to identify duplicates]** section, click the **[!UICONTROL Add attribute]** button to specify the fields for which the identical values allow the duplicates to be identified, such as: email address, first name, last name, etc. The order of the fields allows you to specify those to process first.

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Deduplication settings]** section, select the number of unique **[!UICONTROL Duplicates to keep]**. The default value for this field is **1**. The value **0** allows you to keep all the duplicates.

    For example, if records A and B are considered duplicates of record Y, and a record C is considered as a duplicate of record Z:

    * If the value of the field is **1**: only the Y and Z records are kept.
    * If the value of the field is **0**: all the records are kept.
    * If the value of the field is **2**: records C and Z are kept and two records from A, B, and Y are kept, by chance or depending on the deduplication method selected thereafter.

1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Deduplication method]** to use:

    * **[!UICONTROL Random selection]**: Randomly selects the record to be kept out of the duplicates.
    * **[!UICONTROL Using an expression]**: Keep the records in which the value of the expression entered is the smallest or the biggest.
    * **[!UICONTROL Non-empty values]**: Keep the records for which the expression is not empty.
    * **[!UICONTROL Following a list of values]**: Define a value priority for one or more fields. To define the values, click **[!UICONTROL Attribute]** to select a field or create an expression, then add the value(s) into the appropriate table. To define a new field, click the **[!UICONTROL Add button]** located above the list of values. 

1. Check the **[!UICONTROL Generate complement]** option if you wish to exploit the remaining population. The complement consists of all the duplicates. An additional transition will then be added to the activity.

<!--
## Example{#deduplication-example}

In the following example, use a deduplication activity to exclude duplicates from the target before sending a delivery. The identified duplicated profiles are added to a dedicated audience that can be reused if necessary. Choose the **Email** address to identify the duplicates. Keep 1 entry and select the **Random** deduplication method.
