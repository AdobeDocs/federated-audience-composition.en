To filter a list based on your own criteria, create a custom filter. To do this, browse to the bottom of the filters pane and click the **Add rules** button. [Learn how to create custom filters](#custom)
 
Once applied to a list, filters are visible below the search bar. You can remove an individual filter at any time, or remove all filters by clicking the **Clear all** button. 

## Create custom filters {#custom}

Custom filters allow you to refine lists based on your own specific criteria. They are designed using the query modeler. To create a custom filter, follow these steps:

1. Open the filters pane and click the **Add rules** button located at the bottom of the pane.

1. The query modeler opens. Define and combine your filter criteria to suit your needs. Detailed information on how to use the query modeler is available in [this section](../query/query-modeler-overview.md).

1. Once your custom filter is configured, click **[!UICONTROL Confirm]** to apply it to the list.
