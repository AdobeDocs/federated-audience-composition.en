The toolbar located in the upper-right corner of the canvas provides options to easily manipulate the query components and navigate in the canvas:

* **[!UICONTROL Multiple selection mode]**: Select multiple filtering components to copy and paste them at the location of your choice.
* **[!UICONTROL Rotate]**: Switch the canvas vertically.
* **[!UICONTROL Fit to screen]**: Adapt the canvas zoom level to your screen.
* **[!UICONTROL Zoom out]** / **[!UICONTROL Zoom in]**: Zoom out or in the canvas.
* **[!UICONTROL Display map]**: Opens a snapshot of the canvas showing you are located.

### The Rule properties pane {#rule-properties}

On the right hand side, the **[!UICONTROL Rule properties]** pane provides information on your query. It allows you to perform various operations to check the query and ensure it suits your needs. This pane displays when building a query to create an audience. [Learn how to check and validate your query](build-query.md#check-and-validate-your-query)
