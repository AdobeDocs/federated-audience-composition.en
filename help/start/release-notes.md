# What's new {#rn-new}

## What is Federated Audience Composition {#rn-fac}

Federated Audience Composition allows enterprises to compose data for better utilization across various use cases. With this new approach, as a Adobe Real-Time CDP and/or Adobe Journey Optimizer user, you can federate datasets directly from your existing data warehouse to enrich Adobe Experience Platform audiences and attributes all in one system.

Instead of ingesting datasets and/or audiences into Adobe Experience Platform, you can use Federated Audience Composition to reduce the volume of data copied from your data warehouse into Adobe Experience Platform by pulling specific audiences and attributes out of the warehouse that are needed for certain segmentation or activation use cases, and ensure sensitive data is not persisted outside the warehouse.


>[!AVAILABILITY]
>
>Federated Audience Composition is currently only available for a set of organizations (Limited Availability). To gain access, contact your Adobe representative.
>
>For now, the feature is unavailable for customers who have purchased the Adobe **Healthcare Shield** and **Privacy and Security Shield** add-on offerings.

## Use cases {#rn-uc}

Through a marketing-friendly UI, create segment rules that query your data warehouse for a list of users that qualify for a specific segment needed for marketing campaigns, access existing audiences in the warehouse for activation, or enrich Adobe Experience Platform audiences with additional datapoints that exist in the warehouse.
