# What's new

Federated Audience Composition provides Adobe Real-Time CDP and Adobe Journey Optimizer users with data management flexibility and efficiency. With Federated Audience Composition, You can access your enterprise data warehouse using a marketer-friendly UI to build audiences and leverage datasets in Adobe Experience Platform workflows without persisting underlying enterprise data. This helps you reduce data movement when accessing data warehouses for experience use cases.


## What is Federated Audience Composition

* Federated Audience Composition is a capability that allows enterprises to compose data for better utilization across various use cases. With this new approach, customers of Adobe Real-Time CDP and/or Adobe Journey Optimizer federate datasets directly from their existing data warehouse to enrich Adobe Experience Platform audiences and attributes all in one system.
* This differs from the traditional approach of ingesting raw datasets and/or audiences into Adobe Experience Platform, which requires a copy of data from the data warehouse. With Federated Audience Composition, customers can reduce the volume of data copied from the warehouse into Adobe Experience Platform by pulling specific audiences and attributes out of the warehouse that are needed for certain segmentation or activation use cases and ensure sensitive data is not persisted outside the warehouse.
* Through a marketing-friendly UI, customers can create segment rules that query the warehouse for a list of users that qualify for a specific segment needed for marketing campaigns, access existing audiences in the warehouse for activation, or enrich Adobe Experience Platform audiences with additional datapoints that exist in the warehouse
