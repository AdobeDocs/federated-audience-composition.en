Federated Audience Composition is an add-on capability that equips businesses with flexible and expanded access to enterprise data warehouses to compose audiences using critical enterprise datasets and power brand-initiated and in-the-moment experiences. With this new approach, as an [Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/segmentation/home){target="_blank"} and/or [Adobe Journey Optimizer](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/journey-optimizer/using/ajo-home){target="_blank"} user, you can federate audience data directly from your existing data warehouse to enrich Adobe Experience Platform audiences in one system.

Federated Audience Composition addresses growing market demands for enterprises who need the flexibility to compose audiences with warehouse datasets. This allows businesses to reduce data movement while making critical audience data available to marketing teams to meet use case requirements and power personalized experiences.
