# Get Started with Federated Audience Composition {#gs-fac}

Federated Audience Composition is an add-on capability for [Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/segmentation/home){target="_blank"} and [Adobe Journey Optimizer](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/journey-optimizer/using/ajo-home){target="_blank"}  that allows you to build and enrich audiences from your third-party data warehouses and import the audiences into Adobe Experience Platform. Federated Audience Composition brings an easy and powerful solution to connect your enterprise data warehouse directly within Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform and/or Adobe Journey Optimizer, and perform queries on the tables of your data warehouse. 

Adobe Federated Audience Composition helps Adobe Experience Platform apps users to access their customer data which stored into their data warehouses and cloud storage platforms such as Amazon Redshift, Azure Synapse Analytics, and more. Customer data can live in multiple data warehouses and are now accessible instantly, without replication. Supported platforms are listed in [this page](../connections/federated-db.md#supported-db).

## Capabilities {#rn-capabilities}

Federated Audience Composition extends the value of Real-Time CDP and Journey Optimizer with a comprehensive approach to audience curation and activation:

* Expand access to critical warehouse-based datasets to create high-value audiences: Utilize existing data warehouses as the main system of record, while leveraging best-in-class applications to power great customer experiences.

* Comprehensive support to power engagement use cases: Federated Audience Composition, paired with Real-Time CDP or Journey Optimizer supports brand-initiated, personalized experiences with federated audiences and delivers in-the-moment experiences triggered by real-time events, combined with person attributes to meet use case requirements across teams.

* Minimize data movement and duplication: Create audiences from datasets that live in an enterprise data warehouse without copying underlying data to manage actionable marketing profiles and audiences.

* Utilize a single system for experience-driven workflows: Curate ingested and federated audiences in Adobe Experience Platform and coordinate outbound experiences across all channels.

## Use cases {#rn-uc}

Through a marketing-friendly UI, create segment rules that query your data warehouse for a list of users that qualify for a specific segment needed for marketing campaigns, access existing audiences in the warehouse for activation, or enrich Adobe Experience Platform audiences with additional datapoints that exist in the warehouse. 

In this version, two use cases are available: 

1. Audience Creation:  Build new audiences from enterprise datasets without copying underlying data and activate those audiences with prebuilt destinations.â€‹

1. Audience Enrichment: Enrich existing audiences in Adobe Experience Platform by utilizing composed audience data that has been federated from the enterprise data warehouse. This data will not be persisted in Adobe Experience Platform customer profiles.

Learn how to connect Adobe Experience Platform apps and your enterprise data warehouse, supported databases, and how to configure them are detailed in [this section](../connections/federated-db.md).

2. **Data Modeling**: Design and create data models and schemas that define the structure, relationships, and constraints of the data. Learn more about schemas in [this page](../customer/schemas.md). Learn how to create links for your datamodel in [this page](../data-management/gs-models.md).

3. **Data Transformation**: Apply data manipulation techniques to modify the format, structure, or values of data elements to make them compatible or suitable for specific analysis or applications.

4. **Data Usage**: Create, orchestrate and build audiences. Learn how to compose audiences in [this page](../compositions/gs-compositions.md).
